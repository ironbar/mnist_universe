# Artificial Intelligence

We have seen how a typical AI training looks like. We already have a trained model: is this model intelligent?

That model is performing some operation (classifying handwritten digits) that we do with our brains.
Thus the model is emulating a tiny process of our brain and we could say that it is somehow intelligent.

But in the other hand the model is just a mathematical function. It can only do a very specialized task.
