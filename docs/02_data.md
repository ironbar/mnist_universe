# Data

The model sees pairs of images and labels during training. For example it receives an image of a handwritten 0 and a label indicating that it is a 0.

Thus the model only has access to a very limited subset of the universe. It does not have access to letters, animals, sounds...

Also the model will not experience any notion of time. When a human is learning the numbers there is a time continuity on the senses inputs. 
By contrary the inputs to the model change randomly: there is no relation between the image the model receives at one step and the next.
