# Causality

The goal is to relate that to current NN models that do not interact with the world.

### 1. The Ladder of causation

#### Ladder of causation

>First, very early in our evolution, we humans realized that the world is not made up only of dry facts(what we might call data today); rather these facts are glue together by an intrincate web of cause-effect relationships. 
>Second, causal explanations, not dry facts, make up the bulk of our knowledge, and should be the cornerstone of machine intelligence.

> The goal of strong AI is to produce machines with humanlike intelligence, able to converse with and guide humans. Deep Learning has instead given us machines with truly impressive abilities but no intelligence. The difference is profound and lies in the absence of a model of reality.

> The lack of flexibility and adaptability is inevitable in any system that works at the first level of the ladder of causation

> A sufficiently strong and accurate causal model can allow us to use rung-one (observational) data to answer rung-two (interventional) queries

#### Cognitive revolution

> The Lion Man is a 40k year old sculpture. Is different from previous art because is a creature of previous imagination. Within 10k years after the Lion Man's creation all other hominids had become extinct.

> Humans evolved from apelike ancestors over a period of 6 million years. But in roughly the last 50k years something unique happened, which some call the Cognitive Revolution. Humans acquired the ability to modify their environment and their own abilities at a dramatically faster rate.

> Their newly acquired causal imagination enabled them to do many things more efficiently through a tricky process called "planning".

#### Probability

> Decades' worth of experience with these kinds of questions has convinced me that, in both a cognitive and a philosophical sense, the idea of causes and effects is much more fundamental than the idea of probability. We begin learning causes and effects before we understand language and before we know any mathematics.

> Probabilities, as given by expressions like `P(Y|X)', lie on the first rung of the Ladder of Causation and cannot ever (by themselves) answer queries on the second or third rung. 

> While probabilities encode our beliefs about a static world, causality tells us whether and how probabilities change when the world changes, be it by intervention or by act of imagination.
