# MNIST Universe

![mnist_examples](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/MnistExamples.png)

On this project I will take one of the most famous and simple datasets in the world, the MNIST dataset and I will think about how current artificial intelligence works, what are the differences with natural intelligence and how can we improve it.

The name **MNIST Universe** comes from the fact that a model that is trained on the MNIST dataset only has access to a tiny fraction of the world. Its universe its limited to the 28x28 pixels of the images of the dataset.
