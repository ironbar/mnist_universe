<h4 id="ladder-of-causation">Ladder of causation</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>First, very early in our evolution, we humans realized that the world is not made up only of dry facts(what we might call data today); rather these facts are glue together by an intricate web of cause-effect relationships.<br />
Second, causal explanations, not dry facts, make up the bulk of our knowledge, and should be the cornerstone of machine intelligence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="ladder_causation" src="https://hpccsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ladder-1.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of strong AI is to produce machines with humanlike intelligence, able to converse with and guide humans. Deep Learning has instead given us machines with truly impressive abilities but no intelligence. The difference is profound and lies in the absence of a model of reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>The lack of flexibility and adaptability is inevitable in any system that works at the first level of the ladder of causation</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>A sufficiently strong and accurate causal model can allow us to use rung-one (observational) data to answer rung-two (interventional) queries</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Humans evolved from apelike ancestors over a period of 6 million years. But in roughly the last 50k years something unique happened, which some call the Cognitive Revolution. Humans acquired the ability to modify their environment and their own abilities at a dramatically faster rate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their newly acquired causal imagination enabled them to do many things more efficiently through a tricky process called "planning".</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="probability">Probability</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Decades' worth of experience with these kinds of questions has convinced me that, in both a cognitive and a philosophical sense, the idea of causes and effects is much more fundamental than the idea of probability. We begin learning causes and effects before we understand language and before we know any mathematics.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>Probabilities, as given by expressions like <script type="math/tex">P(Y|X)</script>, lie on the first rung of the Ladder of Causation and cannot ever (by themselves) answer queries on the second or third rung.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While probabilities encode our beliefs about a static world, causality tells us whether and how probabilities change when the world changes, be it by intervention or by act of imagination.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="2-from-buccaneers-to-guinea-pigs">2. From Buccaneers to Guinea Pigs</h3>
<p>This chapter tells the history of how the dominant school of thought in statistics banned causality from science and instead advocated for correlation. It's interesting to see the influence of eminent statisticians. It also tells how Wright battled with them with his path analysis technique.</p>

<h3 id="3-from-evidence-to-causes-reverend-bayes-meets-mr-holmes">3. From Evidence to Causes: Reverend Bayes meets Mr Holmes</h3>
<h4 id="bayes-theorem">Bayes theorem</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Bayer theorem shows that you can deduce the probability of a cause from an effect. If we know the cause it is easy to estimate the probability of the effect, which is a forward probability. Going the other direction is harder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example if we have covid then we know the probability of having a positive result in a covid test (simply look at the FNR of the test). However computing the probability of having covid given that we know that the result of the test is positive is not straightforward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can estimate the conditional probability directly in one direction, for which our judgment is more reliable, and use mathematics to derive the conditional probability in the other direction, for which our judgment is rather hazy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> P(C|T) P(T) = P(T|C) P(C) </script>
</p>
<p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> P(C|T) = \frac{P(T|C) P(C)}{P(T)} = \frac{P(T|C)}{P(T)} P(C) </script>
</p>
<p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> P(C|T) = \frac{(1-FNR) P(C)}{(1-FNR) P(C) + FPR P(\neg C)} </script>
</p>
<p>With that equation we can compute the probability of having covid given that the result of the test was positive.</p>
<p>There is an interesting example of mammogram test to check for breast cancer.</p>
<p>Bayes theorem allows to update our prior belief about something using new information. The likelihood ratio modifies the initial belief.</p>
<p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> P(C|T) = \frac{P(T|C)}{P(T)} P(C) </script>
</p>
<p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> likelihood ratio = \frac{P(T|C)}{P(T)} </script>
</p>
<p>Then there is a tiny glimpse at bayesian networks</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I felt convinced that any artificial intelligence would have to model itself on what we know about human neural information processing and that machine reasoning under uncertainty would have to be constructed with a similar message passing architecture. But what are the messages? This took me quite a few months to figure out. I finally realize that the messages were conditional probabilities in one direction and likelihood ratios in the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="bayesian-networks">Bayesian networks</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A bayesian network carries no assumption that the arrow has a causal meaning. The arrow merely signifies that we know the "forward" probability. Baye's rule tells us how to reverse the procedure, specifically by multiplying the prior probability by a likelihood ratio.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fork junction</strong>. B is often called a confounder of A and C. The confounder will make A and C statistically correlated even thought there is no direct causal link between them. A good example is Shoe Size <script type="math/tex">\leftarrow</script> Age of child <script type="math/tex">\rightarrow</script> Reading ability</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can eliminate this spurious correlation by conditioning on the child's age. If we look only at seven-years-olds we expect to see no relationship between shoe size and reading ability</p>

<p>In this case if we condition on B we will see a negative correlation between A and B. If we look only at famous actors finding out that a celebrity is unattractive increases our belief that he is talented.</p>

</blockquote>
<h4 id="from-bayesian-networks-to-causal-diagrams">From Bayesian networks to causal diagrams</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Bayesian networks hold the key that enables causal diagrams to interface with data. All the probabilistic properties and the belief propagation algorithms remain valid in causal diagrams.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>In a causal diagram the direction of the arrows implies causality whereas on the bayesian networks it only implies the forward probability.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>Causal assumptions cannot be invented at our whim, they are subject to the scrutiny of data and can be falsified (probed that they are wrong)</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>However the graphical properties of the diagram dictate which causal models can be distinguished by data and which will forever remain indistinguishable, no matter how large the data. For example we cannot distinguish the fork  <script type="math/tex">A\leftarrow B\rightarrow C</script> from the chain <script type="math/tex">A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C</script> by data alone because with C listening to B only, the two imply the same independence conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very interesting because it says that data is not enough to create a causal diagram. We need
to make hypothesis about the causal model.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas a Bayesian network can only tell us how likely one event is given that we observed another, causal diagrams can answer interventional and counterfactual questions.</p>

<p>If the confounding variable Z is age, we compare the treatment and control groups in every age group separately. We can then take an average of the effects, weighting each age group according to its percentage in the target population. This method of compensation is familiar to all staticians; it is called "adjusting for Z" or "controlling for Z"</p>

<h4 id="randomized-controlled-trial">Randomized controlled trial</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A randomized controlled trial (or randomized control trial; RCT) is a form of scientific experiment used to control factors not under direct experimental control. Participants who enroll in RCTs differ from one another in known and unknown ways that can influence study outcomes, and yet cannot be directly controlled. By randomly allocating participants among compared treatments, an RCT enables statistical control over these influences. Provided it is designed well, conducted properly, and enrolls enough participants, an RCT may achieve sufficient control over these confounding factors to deliver a useful comparison of the treatments studied.</p>

<ul>
<li>Linear approximation</li>
<li>Regression coefficients</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>For many researchers, the most (perhaps only) familiar method of predicting the effect of an intervention is to “control” for confounders using the adjustment formula. This is the method to use if you are confident that you have data on a sufficient set of variables (called deconfounders) to block all the back-door paths between the intervention and the outcome. To do this, we measure the average causal effect of an intervention by first estimating its effect at each “level,” or stratum, of the deconfounder. We then compute a weighted average of those strata, where each stratum is weighted according to its prevalence in the population. If, for example, the deconfounder is gender, we first estimate the causal effect for males and females. Then we average the two, if the population is (as usual) half male and half female.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>In short, sometimes a regression coefficient represents a causal effect, and sometimes it does not—and you can’t rely on the data alone to tell you the difference. Two additional ingredients are required to endow rYX.Z with causal legitimacy. First, the path diagram should represent a plausible picture of reality, and second, the adjusted variable(s) Z should satisfy the back-door criterion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind also that the regression-based adjustment works only for linear models, which involve a major modeling assumption.</p>

<p>Instead of going in the back door, we can go in the front door! In this case, the front door is the direct causal path Smoking → Tar → Cancer, for which we do have data on all three variables. Intuitively, the reasoning is as follows. First, we can estimate the average causal effect of Smoking on Tar, because there is no unblocked back-door path from Smoking to Tar,
Likewise, the diagram allows us to estimate the average causal effect of Tar on Cancer. To do this we can block the back-door path from Tar to Cancer, Tar ← Smoking ← Smoking Gene → Cancer, by adjusting for Smoking.
Now we know the average increase in the likelihood of tar deposits due to smoking and the average increase of cancer due to tar deposits. We can combine these to obtain the average increase in cancer due to smoking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anytime the causal effect of X on Y is confounded by one set of variables (C) and mediated by another (M) (see Figure 7.2), and, furthermore, the <strong>mediating variables</strong> are shielded from the effects of C, then you can estimate X’s effect from observational data.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Glynn and Kashin’s results show why the front-door adjustment is such a powerful tool: it allows us to control for confounders that we cannot observe (like Motivation), including those that we can’t even name.

<p>Rule 3 is quite simple: it essentially says that we can remove do(X) from P(Y | do(X)) in any case where there are no causal paths from X to Y. That is, if we do something that does not affect Y, then the probability distribution of Y will not change.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Causal Inference is the study of understanding the cause-and-effect relationships in data.</p>
<p>Building a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that represents the causal model typically requires a combination of domain knowledge, theoretical understanding, and, to some extent, data-driven insights. A DAG cannot be fully derived from data alone, as the causal relationships between variables are not inherently present in observational data.
There might be multiple alternative causal models that cannot be falseable from data.</p>
<p>Causal mechanisms describe the processes or pathways through which an effect is produced or a cause leads to an effect. These mechanisms often involve intermediate variables, also known as mediators, that transmit the causal effect from the independent variable (cause) to the dependent variable (effect).</p>
<p>The ladder of causation is a three-level hierarchy of reasoning, introduced by Judea Pearl in "The Book of Why," that describes the stages of understanding causal relationships:</p>
<ol>
<li>Association (bottom rung): At this level, the focus is on observing correlations and patterns in the data. It involves detecting and measuring associations between variables using statistical methods, such as correlation coefficients, regressions, or contingency tables. However, association does not imply causation.</li>
<li>Intervention (middle rung): This level goes beyond mere associations and seeks to understand the causal effects of interventions. It answers questions like "What if we do something?" or "What happens if we change a variable?" To understand causal effects, researchers often perform controlled experiments, like randomized controlled trials, or use observational data and methods like matching, instrumental variables, or difference-in-differences to estimate causal relationships.</li>
<li>Counterfactuals (top rung): Counterfactual reasoning represents the highest level of causal understanding. It involves asking "What if" questions about alternative realities or hypothetical scenarios that did not occur but could have. Counterfactual reasoning allows us to compare the actual outcome under the observed intervention with the potential outcome under a different intervention. This level of reasoning enables us to make causal attributions, explain observed phenomena, and inform decision-making.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe I have a good understanding of causality now. There is some math that I still don't understand but I believe I should put the focus on AI, and only if needed delve deeper into causality.</p>
